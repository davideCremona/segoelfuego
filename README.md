# Sego-el-fuego

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a system capable of detecting a potential risk or presence of wildfires and to give a localization when possible. The system also alerts the forest area owner or the responsible public authority.

## 2. Phases

The project will initially have two phases:
- Research and analysis
- POC development

### Phase 1: Research and Analysis

In this phase we should search for informations about the problem and try to come up with a list of technology and methods to accomplish the project objective.
We should research informations about:
- Understand the data we need (e.g. local humidity, temperature, co2 concentration, ...).
- Understand how to obtain and collect the data and the technology needed (the infrastructure from sensors to processing units).
- How to analyze the data and come up with algorithms or methods to predict the risk of wildfires from the data.
- How to inform the public authority or the forest area owner in the most effective and efficient way.

All these topics needs to be well documented and we should find out from lecterature methods and technology that can help us to accomplish our objective. 

### Phase 2: POC Development

In this phase we should develop a minimal proof of concept that we can test in a localized environment.
The development of a POC is useful to test our solution on a small scale before trying to scale up the system.
