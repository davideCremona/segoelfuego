Here we store interesting links along with the reading status (read, not read) and if it has been read then we add a short description.

- https://www.dryad.net/ read partially, This is a startup that has been developing a system similar to what we have in mind. Maybe we could take inspiration from their work.
- https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/fire-detection read partially, This is a collection of interesting articles about the fire detection problem.

can be relevant these articles: 

***Fire Detection â€“ Smoke and Heat Detection Systems*** This article spoke about Fire-detection systems listing the types and how these works.
It's relevant to know that there are smoke, heat, optical, aspired systems.
